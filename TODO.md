    - serve normal basic files availables in the public folder
    - parse url path to redirect to the appropriate html file content(like a rooter)

- generate html websites
    - open and parse yaml files
    - write those parsed yaml files into html (in the public folder)
    - open and parse markdown files
    - write those parsed markdown files into yaml (now html pages)
